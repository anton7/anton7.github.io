      <description>Java Java is an Object-Oriented language, not coffee.
Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.
These are my simple notes for reference online.
Collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other&amp;rsquo;s methods
 Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A cat has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, meowing, eating.</description>
